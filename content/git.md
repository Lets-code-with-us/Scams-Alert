# Ultimate Git Cheatsheet: From Beginner to Advanced

**The Complete Guide to Version Control with Git**

> Git is the most widely-used version control system that helps developers track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain code quality. This comprehensive cheatsheet provides everything you need to master Git - from basic commands to advanced techniques.

## Why Use Git?

- **History Tracking**: Keep a complete history of all changes made to your codebase
- **Collaboration**: Work seamlessly with team members without overwriting each other's work
- **Branching**: Create separate environments for developing new features without affecting the main codebase
- **Backup**: Store your code securely on remote repositories
- **Experimentation**: Try new ideas without risking your stable code
- **Accountability**: Always know who made what changes and when

Let's start with the essential commands every developer should know!

## Basic Git Commands for Beginners üöÄ

Every Git journey starts with these fundamental commands. Master these basics and you'll be well on your way to effective version control!

### Initialize a Repository
```bash
# Create a new Git repository in your current directory
git init
```
**What it does**: Transforms your current directory into a Git repository by creating a hidden `.git` folder that stores all version history.

**When to use it**: When starting a new project or wanting to track an existing project with Git.

### Check Status
```bash
# View the status of your working directory
git status

# Short status format (more concise output)
git status -s
```
**What it does**: Shows which files have been changed, which are staged for commit, and which aren't being tracked by Git.

**Pro tip**: Run this command frequently! It's your best friend for understanding the current state of your repository.

### Stage Changes
```bash
# Add a specific file to the staging area
git add filename.txt

# Add multiple files
git add file1.txt file2.txt

# Add all files in the current directory
git add .

# Add all files of a specific type (e.g., all JavaScript files)
git add *.js
```
**What it does**: Prepares your changes to be committed by moving them to the "staging area" (think of it as a loading dock before shipping).

**Why it matters**: This two-step process (stage then commit) gives you fine control over exactly which changes go into each commit.

### Commit Changes
```bash
# Commit staged changes with a message
git commit -m "Your commit message here"

# Add changes and commit in one command (only works for modified files, not new files)
git commit -am "Add and commit message"
```
**What it does**: Creates a permanent snapshot of your staged changes in the Git history.

**Best practice**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages that explain *why* the change was made, not just *what* was changed. Follow the convention of using present tense: "Add login feature" instead of "Added login feature".

### Push/Pull
```bash
# Push your local commits to the remote repository
git push origin main

# Download changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local branch
git pull origin main

# Fetch changes without automatically merging
git fetch origin
```
**Push**: Uploads your commits to the remote repository so others can see your changes.

**Pull**: Downloads changes from the remote repository and integrates them into your local branch.

**Fetch vs. Pull**: `fetch` just downloads the changes without merging them, giving you a chance to review before integrating with `merge`. `pull` is essentially `fetch` + `merge` in one command.

## Branching and Merging: The Power of Parallel Development üåø

Branching is one of Git's most powerful features, allowing teams to work on multiple features simultaneously without interference.

### Branches
```bash
# List all branches (* indicates current branch)
git branch

# List remote branches
git branch -r

# List both local and remote branches
git branch -a

# Create a new branch (but stay on current branch)
git branch branch-name

# Create and switch to a new branch (most common approach)
git checkout -b branch-name

# Switch to an existing branch
git checkout branch-name

# Switch to the previous branch you were on
git checkout -
```
**What are branches?**: Think of branches as separate versions or timelines of your project. The main branch (often called `main` or `master`) usually contains the stable version, while feature branches are used to develop new functionality without disturbing the main codebase.

**Branch naming conventions**: Use descriptive names like `feature/login-system`, `bugfix/header-alignment`, or `refactor/database-queries`.

### Merging
```bash
# Merge a branch into your current branch
git merge branch-name

# Merge with a custom commit message
git merge branch-name -m "Merge message"

# Abort a merge if you encounter conflicts and want to start over
git merge --abort
```
**What it does**: Combines changes from one branch into another, typically to incorporate completed features into the main codebase.

**Merge workflow**: 
1. Finish your work on a feature branch
2. Switch to the receiving branch (e.g., `git checkout main`) 
3. Merge the feature branch (`git merge feature-branch`)
4. Resolve any conflicts if they occur
5. Push the updated main branch to the remote repository

**When you might encounter conflicts**: When the same part of a file has been changed differently in both branches. Don't panic! Git will mark the conflicts and ask you to resolve them manually.

### Delete Branches
```bash
# Delete a local branch
git branch -d branch-name

# Force delete a local branch
git branch -D branch-name

# Delete a remote branch
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

## Commit History: Understanding Your Project Timeline üìú

The ability to see the complete history of changes is one of Git's most valuable features, especially for debugging and understanding project evolution.

### View Logs
```bash
# View commit history
git log

# View condensed log (one line per commit)
git log --oneline

# View log with graph visualization (great for understanding branch structure)
git log --graph --oneline --decorate

# View log for a specific file
git log filename.txt

# View changes made in each commit (shows actual code changes)
git log -p

# View stats for each commit (how many lines changed in each file)
git log --stat
```
**When to use it**: When you need to understand the project's history, see who made what changes, or find when a specific change was introduced.

**Pro tip**: Add the `--author="username"` flag to filter commits by a specific person, or use `--since="2 weeks ago"` to limit the time range.

### Comparing Changes
```bash
# Compare working directory with staging area
git diff

# Compare staging area with last commit
git diff --staged

# Compare two branches
git diff branch1 branch2

# Compare two commits
git diff commit1 commit2

# Compare a file between two commits
git diff commit1 commit2 -- filename
```

## Advanced Git Commands: Level Up Your Version Control Skills üî•

These more sophisticated commands help you handle complex scenarios and give you greater control over your Git workflow.

### Stashing Changes: The Temporary Drawer
```bash
# Temporarily save uncommitted changes and revert to a clean working directory
git stash

# Save stash with a descriptive message
git stash save "Work in progress on login feature"

# List all your saved stashes
git stash list

# Apply most recent stash without removing it from the stash list
git stash apply

# Apply a specific stash by its index
git stash apply stash@{2}

# Apply and remove most recent stash (common usage)
git stash pop

# Remove a specific stash without applying it
git stash drop stash@{1}

# Remove all stashed changes
git stash clear
```
**What is stashing?**: Think of it as a clipboard or drawer where you can temporarily store changes you're not ready to commit. 

**When to use it**: 
1. When you need to switch branches but aren't ready to commit your changes
2. When you want to try an alternate approach without losing your current work
3. When you need to pull changes but have uncommitted local modifications

### Rebasing
```bash
# Rebase current branch onto another branch
git rebase main

# Interactive rebase for more control
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Rebase last 3 commits

# Continue a rebase after resolving conflicts
git rebase --continue

# Abort a rebase
git rebase --abort
```

### Resetting
```bash
# Unstage a file (keep changes in working dir)
git reset filename.txt

# Unstage all files
git reset

# Reset to a previous commit (keep changes)
git reset commit-hash

# Reset to a previous commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard commit-hash

# Reset to remote branch state
git reset --hard origin/main
```

## Remote Repositories: Collaborating with the World üåê

Remote repositories are versions of your project hosted on the internet or a network, enabling collaboration with others.

### Manage Remotes
```bash
# View all remote repositories and their URLs
git remote -v

# Add a remote repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git

# Change the URL of an existing remote
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/repo.git

# Remove a remote repository connection
git remote remove origin
```
**What are remotes?**: Remote repositories are copies of your Git repository hosted elsewhere - typically on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. The standard name for the primary remote is "origin".

**Why use remotes?**: They allow for:
- Backup of your code
- Collaboration with other developers
- Continuous integration/deployment workflows
- Code reviews via pull/merge requests

### Clone Repository
```bash
# Clone a repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git

# Clone to a specific directory
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git my-directory

# Clone a specific branch
git clone -b branch-name https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

### Fetch and Pull
```bash
# Fetch from all remotes
git fetch --all

# Fetch a specific remote
git fetch origin

# Pull with rebase instead of merge
git pull --rebase origin main
```

## Configuration: Setting Up Git for Success ‚öôÔ∏è

Properly configuring Git is essential for effective collaboration and maintaining a clean commit history.

### User Information
```bash
# Set global username (used for all repositories unless overridden)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set global email address
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Set username for a specific repository only
git config user.name "Your Name"
```
**Why it matters**: Your name and email will be attached to every commit you make, helping others identify who made which changes.

**Best practice**: Use the same email address that you use for your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account to ensure proper attribution.

### View Configuration
```bash
# View all configurations
git config --list

# View global configurations
git config --global --list

# View specific setting
git config user.name
```

### Default Editor
```bash
# Set default editor
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"  # VS Code
git config --global core.editor "vim"          # Vim
git config --global core.editor "nano"         # Nano
```

## Useful Git Tips: Save Time and Avoid Common Mistakes ‚ö°

These shortcuts and techniques will make your Git workflow smoother and help you recover from mistakes.

### Undoing Changes: Everyone Makes Mistakes
```bash
# Discard changes to a file (restore it to the last committed state)
git checkout -- filename.txt

# Discard all changes in working directory (dangerous - you'll lose all uncommitted work!)
git checkout -- .

# Safely undo a commit by creating a new commit that reverses the changes
git revert commit-hash

# Fix the last commit message
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"

# Add forgotten files to the last commit without changing the commit message
git add forgotten-file.txt
git commit --amend --no-edit
```
**Safety tip**: Before using destructive commands like `checkout -- .` or `reset --hard`, consider making a backup with `git stash` so you can recover if needed.

**When to use revert vs. reset**: Use `revert` when the commit has already been pushed to a shared repository. Use `reset` only for local changes that haven't been shared.

### Tagging
```bash
# List all tags
git tag

# Create a lightweight tag
git tag v1.0.0

# Create an annotated tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"

# Tag a specific commit
git tag -a v0.9.0 commit-hash -m "Tag message"

# Push tags to remote
git push origin --tags

# Push a specific tag
git push origin v1.0.0

# Delete a local tag
git tag -d v1.0.0

# Delete a remote tag
git push --delete origin v1.0.0
```

### Ignoring Files: Keep Your Repository Clean
```bash
# Create a .gitignore file in your repository root
touch .gitignore
```

#### Common .gitignore patterns:
```bash
# Ignore specific file
filename.txt
secrets.json
.env

# Ignore file extensions
*.log
*.tmp
*.zip
*.pdf

# Ignore directories
node_modules/    # NPM packages
dist/            # Build output
.vscode/         # Editor settings
__pycache__/     # Python cache
.idea/           # JetBrains IDEs

# Ignore all files in a directory except specific ones
logs/*
!logs/.gitkeep   # Keep the logs directory in Git but ignore its contents
```
**What should you ignore?**:
- Build artifacts and compiled code
- Dependencies that can be reinstalled (npm packages, pip packages)
- Environment-specific configuration files
- User-specific IDE settings
- Temporary files, logs, and caches
- Sensitive information (API keys, credentials, .env files)

**Pro tip**: Visit [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/) to generate comprehensive .gitignore files for your specific languages and tools.

### Aliases
```bash
# Create a git alias
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.br branch
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.st status

# Create a complex alias
git config --global alias.logline "log --graph --oneline --decorate"
```

### Cleaning
```bash
# Remove untracked files (dry run)
git clean -n

# Remove untracked files
git clean -f

# Remove untracked files and directories
git clean -fd

# Remove ignored files too
git clean -fdx
```
